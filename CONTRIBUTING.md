# Contributing

Contributions to this software are greatly appreciated. Here are
some general guidelines for contributors.

## 🧠 Open an Issue First

Before submitting a pull request (PR), please open an issue describing
the bug or feature to be addressed so that it can be discussed.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features may be beyond the scope or nature of this
> software and will not be added.

Opening an issue before a PR ensures that you don't waste any
time developing a feature that is beyond the plugins scope.

## 🔍 Keep Changes Scoped and Focused

PRs should address one topic at a time. Minor inconsequential changes
that are not necessarily within the scope of the topic are permitted
and welcome (No one wants a PR to add a period to the end of a sentence).

For instance, in a PR to add YAML support:
* ✅ Fixing a typo in `README.md` during a feature PR is okay.
* ❌ Refactoring unrelated rendering code while adding YAML support is not  
is consequential and unrelated.

## 🤝 Be Respectful & Collaborative
* Communicate clearly and professionally (i.e. just act like adults).
* DO NOT use profanity in code, comments, or discussion. **Use of
profanity will not be tolerated.**

## 🧪 Use Type Annotations

It makes everyone's lives easier in the long run.
